# hostile-aliens

Completed in 2 hours with a brief of making a text-based alien invasion style game.
Requirements included using <150 lines of code, specifics about different styles and behaviours of ships.
When the mother ship is destroyed, the game is won.
Using basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

This was achieved after 4 weeks of my _nology course.
