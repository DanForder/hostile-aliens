## Hostile Aliens
### Overview
A tech test style brief given to us on week 4 of the _nology front-end coding bootcamp. The task was to create a simple text-only game with a single button that hits a random alien ship in the fleet. Each time the button is pressed, a random alien ship is hit and its hit points are reduced. Once an alien ships points have hit zero the ship is destroyed and canâ€™t be hit again. The game is over once all alien ships have been destroyed.

### The Brief
- You should be able to start a new game once the game is over.
- Some text visualisation of the ships and their hit points.
- Use 150 lines of code or fewer, all on one HTML file
- When the mother ship is destroyed, the game is won
- You have 2 hours

### Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Current State
- User can press a fire button, randomly damaging an alien ship
- Responsive to small and large screens

### How-to
- Clone the repo
- Run a live server on index.html
